/**
 * Docker Volume
 * 
 * @galasa.annotation
 * 
 * @galasa.description The code>{@literal @}DockerVolume</code> annotation provides the capability to bind or provision docker volumes. The 
 * volumes were desgined with three Docker volume use cases in mind:
 *  1. Mounting configuration - in this usecase any volume to be mounted contains configuration data and must not be edited by the running 
 *     container, as this could affect parallelization of test running. Therefore, in the DockerVolume annotation, if a volume name is provided 
 *     (aka already exists), the mount will be read only.
 *  2. Sharing volumes - when a volume is required for multiple containers to use to share data. This shoult not be a provided volume, so it 
 *     is expected that a volume name will not be passed to the DockerVolume annotation, and the docker engine will generate a name. This 
 *     volume will be tagged for later reference. Current limitation is that the config used to provision the volume must be used for all 
 *     containers wanting to mount the same volume. This results in the path having to be the same in all containers.
 *  3. Persisting data - There may be a use case for a volume to exsist outside the life span of the test. For this I have encorparated a 
 *     boolean called persist on the DockerVolume annotation. This is not indefinate, but controlled by resource management. A good default 
 *     would probably be 24 hours, but can utimately be set by the user with a CPS property.
 * 
 * @galasa.examples
 * <code>{@literal @}DockerContainerConfig(
 *      dockerVolumes =  {
 *           // A read only mount, as a specific volume was requested.    
 *           @DockerVolume(volumeName = config, mountPath = "/configs"),
 *           // A data volume that will persist past the life of the test
 *           @DockerVolume(mountPath = "/data", persist = true),
 *           // A sharing volume that will be cleanup post test.
 *           @DockerVolume(mountPath = "/mnt/appShare"),
 *       }
 *   )
 *   public IDockerContainerConfig config;
 * </code>
